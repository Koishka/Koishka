- 👋 Hi, I’m @Koishka
- 👀 I’m interested in a LOT of things, curiosity is kinda of my thing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development (full stack) and I can tell... It's gonna be a long way! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... something... someday...? (linked with my actual work in teaching languages)
- 📫 How to reach me: you can find my profile on LinkedIn but with my real name.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her.
- ⚡ Fun fact: did you know "oiseau" is one word in French where no letters are pronounced? Now, you do.
